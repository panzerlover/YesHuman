            <h1>Stop Asking</h1>
            <p>Many people are asking if it is really a standard human. Most of course it is!
                Just by asking peoples are revealing the ignorance.
            </p>
            <p>There are simply many ways of which it is human. Let us ponder some of these items</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Standard amount of skin</li>
                <li>Correct number of eyes</li>
                <li>Acceptable placement of hair</li>
                <li>Easy responding to audio output of nearby humans</li>
                <li>Only sometimes bites other humans</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The real questioning that should be asking is about the thing that fly, Birds.
                <a href="https://birdsarentreal.com/"> See how many others are agreed.
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>How can these so-called Birds travel through the air? That is not standard. Their scales
            are soft and do not stop attacks. For what purpose are scales? We are just asking questions of course.
            </p>
            <p>Observe the i2nternal of birds. It is far from standard.
                 <a href="https://i.redd.it/te56ehnjxq731.png" target="_blank">
                     Just see for yourself how not standard birds are.</a> Compare the standard level of birds with that of
                     such a normal human. It does not compare favorably.             
            </p>
            <p>
            Yes, instead should be asking questions of Birds and not of what is certainly a very standard human. I for myself am quite convinced and have heard of many others who now feel also.
